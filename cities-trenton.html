                <p>Trenton has a rich early history dating back to its founding in 1679 by Quaker settlers. Originally known as "Trent-towne" after William Trent, one of its leading landowners, the city was officially incorporated in 1792. Trenton played a pivotal role in the American Revolution, most notably as the site of George Washington's victory at the Battle of Trenton in 1776. Its strategic location along the Delaware River contributed to its growth as a commercial and industrial hub in the early years of the United States.
