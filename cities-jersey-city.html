                    Jersey City has a rich history dating back to the early 17th century when Dutch settlers established the area as Pavonia, later known as Bergen—the first permanent European settlement in what would become New Jersey. The city underwent several incorporations, officially becoming Jersey City on February 22, 1838. Throughout the 19th century, it expanded by annexing neighboring municipalities, including Van Vorst Township in 1851 and Bergen City and Hudson City in 1870, evolving into a bustling port city on New York Harbor.
